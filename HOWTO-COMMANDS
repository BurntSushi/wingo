What is Gribble?
================
Gribble is a simple command oriented language that can be used to control the 
behavior of Wingo. Such behavior includes, but is not limited to: changing the 
workspace, changing the active window, querying Wingo for information about 
state, and even restarting Wingo itself (useful when upgrading or changing the 
configuration).

(The gophers out there might be interested to know that each command is 
declared by reflection via a single struct. See 
https://github.com/BurntSushi/gribble)

In Wingo, commands are extremely important because they are used everywhere. 
They are used for key bindings, mouse bindings, hooks and can be run via the 
WingoExec prompt. They can be run via the `wingo-cmd` program, or if you're 
more savvy, can be run from opening up a socket yourself. (See the end for an 
example in Python.)


Get wingo-cmd working
=====================
Throughout this document, I'll invoke `wingo-cmd` several times. It's extremely 
useful because it provides documentation (types and description) for *every*
command.

If you don't have it and you used `go get` to install Wingo, then:

    go get github.com/BurntSushi/wingo/wingo-cmd

should install it. If you don't have it and didn't use `go get` to install
Wingo, then you probably installed Wingo via your package manager. In that 
case, either speak to the package maintainer or get Go installed on your system 
and use `go get` to install Wingo. (See the INSTALL file.)

If you can't get `wingo-cmd` installed, then you can use the `WingoHelp` 
command while Wingo is running to get usage information for a particular 
command.

In the worst case, you can use the Go package docs, but it's a bit harder
to read:

How to run commands
===================
Wingo needs to be running.

There are two common ways to run a command. One is from within Wingo using one 
of its prompts. If you have a vanilla configuration, you can bring up such a 
prompt with "Mod4+Shift+r" (mod4 is usually the "super" or "windows" key on 
your keyboard).

The other way to run a command is with `wingo-cmd`. For example, while Wingo is 
running:

    wingo-cmd 'AddWorkspace "embiggen"'


Break it down
=============
At first glance, Wingo commands look like regular old shell commands:

    AddWorkspace "embiggen"

Here, we're invoking the "AddWorkspace" command and passing a string 
"embiggen", which should add a new workspace called "embiggen".

If you use `wingo-cmd` to get usage information for this command, we'll see 
that my description is correct:

    wingo-cmd --usage AddWorkspace

    AddWorkspace (Name :: string)
        Adds a new workspace to Wingo with a name Name. Note that a workspace 
        name must be unique with respect to other workspaces and must have 
        non-zero length.

Note here that the first parameter also says that it has to be a string. What 
happens if you give it an integer?

    AddWorkspace 5

Go ahead, try it.

Some commands don't need any arguments:

    Restart

Some commands usually take the output of another command as an argument:

    Focus (GetActive)

So what is the usage for Focus?

    wingo-cmd --usage Focus

    Focus (Client :: int | string)
        Focuses the window specified by Client.
        
        Client may be the window id or a substring that matches a window name.

So Focus accepts one argument called Client, and the type is annotated as
"int | string", which in English means "an integer OR a string". In this case, 
GetActive returns the identifier (an integer) of the currently active 
window---so its return value is a valid argument to Focus.

If you squint a bit, and add the optional outside parantheses, Gribble is a bit 
closer to a Lisp dialect:

    (Focus (GetActive))


Advanced command usage
======================
Wingo also provides several different kinds of prompts that can be used as 
input to Gribble commands---which makes the command system truly dynamic with 
respect to user input.

For example, remember the AddWorkspace command we had above?

    AddWorkspace "embiggen"

Things are a bit more flexible if we bind this to a keybinding:

    AddWorkspace (Input "Workspace name:")

But what does Input do?

    wingo-cmd --usage Input

    Input (Label :: string)
        Shows a centered prompt window that allows the user to type in text. If
        the user presses the Confirm Key (i.e., enter), then the text typed
        into the input box will be returned.
        
        Label will be shown next to the input box.
        
        This command may be used as a sub-command to pass user provided
        arguments to another command.

So we've now created a command that will prompt the user for some text, and 
pass the entered text as an argument to a command.

There are also other prompts available too. Namely, there are prompts that list 
workspaces and clients. We can use them together in the same command!

    WorkspaceSendClient \
        (SelectWorkspace "Prefix") \
        (SelectClient "Any" "no" "no" "yes")

(N.B. The '\' is used as a line continuation. It can be used in your 
configuration files if you're as crazy about 80 columns as I am.
Otherwise, you can put everything on one line and omit the '\' characters.)

So let's take a look at the types of each of the commands:

    WorkspaceSendClient (Workspace :: int | string) (Client :: int | string)
    SelectWorkspace (TabCompletion :: string)
    SelectClient (TabCompletion :: string) \
                 (OnlyActiveWorkspace :: string) \
                 (OnlyVisible :: string) \
                 (ShowIconified :: string)

The effect of this command is that first you'll see a prompt to select a 
workspace. Then you'll see a prompt to select a client. Then the client 
selected will be sent to the workspace selected. This works because the
SelectWorkspace command passes a workspace as the first argument, and 
SelectClient passes a client as the second argument.


Python, Sockets and Gribble... Oh my!
=====================================
Wingo uses Unix Domain Sockets for its inter-process communication mechanism. 
In order to send commands to Wingo, you'll have to create a Unix socket 
connection.

The IPC mechanism is very simple. Firstly, every message is terminated by the 
null character (byte 0). Secondly, the client protocol is to send a null 
terminated command and wait for a null terminated response. After which, the 
client may send another command.

The response may be empty (just the null byte), may contain an error string or 
may contain the return value of the command if it has one.

The socket connection should be located in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wingo`, or if
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is not set, then `/tmp/wingo` (or whatever your system's
temporary directory is). The name of the socket should be equivalent to the
value of your `$DISPLAY` string (i.e., `:display-number:screen`).

What follows is a simple template program for Python that provides a function 
"gribble" that will run a command and return the value received in response.

The source code can be found in scripts/wingo-cmd-example.py.

import os
import os.path
import socket

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
f = os.path.join(os.getenv('XDG_RUNTIME_DIR'), 'wingo', os.getenv('DISPLAY'))
sock.connect(f)


def recv(sock):
    data = ''
    while chr(0) not in data:
        data += sock.recv(4096)
    return data


def gribble(cmd):
    sock.send("%s%s" % (cmd, chr(0)))
    return recv(sock)


print gribble("GetClientName (GetActive)")

sock.close()
