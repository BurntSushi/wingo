Archlinux users: Wingo is in the AUR under 'wingo-git'.

Quick Install Instructions
==========================
Since Wingo is a pure Go program, the best way to install Wingo is with the Go 
tool. If you have a Go environment already set up, this is as easy as:

    go get github.com/BurntSushi/wingo
    go get github.com/BurntSushi/wingo/wingo-cmd # optional

The first command installs the Wingo window manager and the second installs the 
command that can be used to interact with Wingo from the command line.

If you don't have Go, then it's only a short hop, skip and a jump to install 
it: (But check if your Linux distribution has already packaged Wingo, and if 
so, use that instead.)

In all likelihood, your Linux distribution probably has a Go package available 
for you to install (search the keywords "google" and "go"). If so, install it.
Then add the following to your ~/.bashrc (or equivalent):

    export GOPATH="$HOME/go"
    export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"

And now you should be able to run the aforementioned commands. The Wingo 
binary will be installed to $HOME/go/bin if you used the same paths as above.


Running Wingo
=============
The most lightweight way to run Wingo is to run it all by itself---without a 
desktop environment like KDE or GNOME. To do so, just add

    exec wingo

to your $HOME/.xinitrc file. When you login to a tty, just run `startx`. 
Although, all the cool kids say you should use this instead:

    exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch wingo

If you want some nice logging (especially if you're reporting a bug), use:

    exec wingo -p 1 --log-level 3 > $HOME/wingo.log 2>&1

(The "-p 1" option is to force Wingo into sequential execution. This makes sure
no error messages are cut off if Wingo crashes.)


Configuring Wingo
=================
Running

    wingo --write-config

will (in all likelihood) write a fresh copy of the configuration files to your 
$HOME/.config/wingo directory. The configuration files are full of comments.


Running Wingo in KDE
====================
I've done a little bit of testing with KDE, and Wingo is serviceable. It isn't 
an ideal experience (especially if you have multiple monitors), but it seems to 
work well enough.

To swap your window manager in place, you can run this while KDE is running:

    wingo --replace

Or to change Wingo to the default window manager which will be used whenever 
KDE starts, create a new file in $HOME/.kde4/env, set the KDEWM environment
variable, and make it executable:

    echo 'export KDEWM="wingo"' > $HOME/.kde4/env/wm.sh
    chmod +x $HOME/.kde4/env/wm.sh

Remove the file if you want to switch back to regular KDE. Or you can run this 
command to temporarily switch to KDE's default window manager while Wingo is 
running:

    kwin --replace


Running Wingo in GNOME (or anything else)
=========================================
I don't know.
