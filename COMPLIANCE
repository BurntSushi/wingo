Compliance with desktop standards
=================================
This is an attempt at documenting Wingo's compliance with desktop standards. At 
this time, this only includes ICCCM [1], EWMH [2] and the XDG Base Directory
Specification.

Inconsistencies in this document with actual Wingo behavior should be 
considered bugs.

ICCCM
=====
I have attempted to include some status for all relevant portions of the ICCCM
as they relate to window managers. If I've missed a section, please file a
bug report.

+     2.8       WM_S{X screen number}

+     4.1.2.1   WM_NAME (when _NET_WM_NAME isn't present)
-     4.1.2.2   WM_ICON_NAME
/     4.1.2.3   WM_NORMAL_HINTS (missing aspect ratios)
+     4.1.2.4   WM_HINTS (icon_pixmap used when _NET_WM_ICON isn't present)
+     4.1.2.5   WM_CLASS
+     4.1.2.6   WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
/     4.1.2.7   WM_PROTOCOLS (only WM_TAKE_FOCUS and WM_DELETE_WINDOW)
-     4.1.2.8   WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS
-     4.1.2.9   WM_CLIENT_MACHINE
+     4.1.3.1   WM_STATE
-     4.1.3.2   WM_ICON_SIZE (Wingo resizes icons to fit)
+     4.1.4     State transitions (Normal, Iconic and Withdrawn)
/     4.1.5     Configuring window (stacking changes aren't allowed)
+     4.1.6     Wingo respects override redirect flag
+     4.1.7     All focus models supported (no input, passive, local, global)
-     4.1.8     Wingo doesn't do anything with colormaps
/     4.1.9     Icons (used in absence of _NET_WM_ICON; icon_window is ignored)
+     4.1.10    Wingo respects WM_TRANSIENT_FOR and override redirect
/     4.1.11    Wingo sometimes uses window groups to determine transients

+     4.2.1     All Wingo clients are reparented; SaveSets are used
+     4.2.2     Wingo redirects all Map/Configure requests
+     4.2.3     Wingo sends synthetic ConfigureNotify events when appropriate
+     4.2.4     Wingo does not send synthetic ConfigureNotify events on resize
+     4.2.5     Wingo supports Iconification and updates WM_STATE
-     4.2.6     Wingo doesn't do anything with colormaps
+     4.2.7     SetInputFocus and WM_TAKE_FOCUS are used appropriately
+     4.2.8     ClientMessage format
+     4.2.8.1   DestroyWindow is used when WM_DELETE_WINDOW is not present
+     4.2.9     Wingo selects SubstructureRedirect on root and frame windows

-     4.3       Complies with 2.8 but no selection conversion. (No point IMO)

-     4.5       No session support


EWMH
====
Wingo diverges from most mainstream window managers in that multiple workspaces 
are visible at one time when multiple monitors are present. Typically, window 
managers stretch a single workspace across all monitors. There are several 
parts of the EWMH that implicitly assume that one and only one workspace is 
viewable.

As a result, there are several EWMH properties that Wingo *cannot* suppport (or 
can only partially support). Details are provided below on a case by case 
basis. Additionally, Wingo adds a new property to track which workspaces are 
visible:

_NET_VISIBLE_DESKTOPS
---------------------
_NET_VISIBLE_DESKTOPS, CARDINAL[n]/32

A list of n integers corresponding to the indices of each desktop viewable on n 
separate monitors. The list should be ordered by monitor geometry, from left to 
right then top to bottom.

N.B. Maybe this should be the order of Xinerama screens reported, but either 
ordering is unambiguous.

Status
------
I have attempted to include some status on each portion of the EWMH. If I've 
missed anything, please file a bug report.

I've marked properties which I believe have a good chance of being supported in 
the future with a '*'. Other unsupported properties are either excluded because 
of Wingo's workspace model or because I don't have the motivation to work on 
them.

(N.B. The list below is machine readable and used to automatically generate the
      'ewmh_supported.go' file. All properties labeled '+' or '/' are added
      to the _NET_SUPPORTED list.)

/  _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS      Read-only. Workspaces must be added or removed
                                by using Wingo's "AddWorkspace" or
                                "RemoveWorkspace" commands.
/  _NET_DESKTOP_GEOMETRY        Read-only. Just stores the root window
                                geometry. Multiple workspaces can have
                                variable geometry simultaneously, so this
                                property can't be fully supported.

                                geometries simultaneously, and it's impossible
                                to know what geometry a hidden workspace might
                                have. Any attempt at setting this causes KDE to
                                explode.

Motif
=====
/  _MOTIF_WM_HINTS

According to my limited experience, MOTIF hints still seem to be used in the
wild to indicate when a client doesn't want decorations. (The EWMH tries to 
solve this semantically, but just doesn't account for things like Google Chrome 
that have their own decorations.)

Thus, Wingo inspects _MOTIF_WM_HINTS, and if the DecorationAll,
DecorationTitle and DecorationResizeH hints are all disabled, Wingo will not
decorate a window. Wingo will listen for changes on this property and adjust
decorations appropriately.


XDG Base Directory Specification
================================
Wingo follows all of the rules detailed in the specification for the
XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_CONFIG_DIRS environment variables. (They are only used
to locate and write configuration files.)
