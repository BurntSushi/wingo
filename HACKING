Some general tips/advice/guidelines on hacking Wingo.

Setting up your own fork
========================
Aftering forking Wingo on github, the first thing you'll have to do is switch 
all of the Wingo imports from my repository to your own. So for instance, let's 
say your github username is 'plato', then the following sed command in the 
Wingo project root will do the trick:

  find ./ -name '*.go' -print0 | xargs -0 \
    sed -i 's#github.com/BurntSushi/wingo#github.com/plato/wingo#g'

Note here that you will only want to replace github.com/BurntSushi/wingo import 
paths and not all github.com/BurntSushi import paths, since the xgb and xgbutil 
packages are also owned by me. (Unless you plan on forking those too.)

This command will touch the vast majority of files in the Wingo tree, so make 
sure you commit the changes right afterwards.
